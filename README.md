# Predict Podcast Listening Time

This project predicts the listening time of podcast episodes using machine learning.  
The dataset comes from the Kaggle Playground Series S5E4 competition:  
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e4

- Achieved RMSE: 13.8  
- Winning RMSE on Kaggle: 11.4  

## How to Use
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the `sample_data/` folder.  
2. Install the required libraries:  
3. Run the script:  
4. The predictions will be saved as `Submission.csv` for Kaggle submission.

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- Optuna for hyperparameter tuning  

This project provides a solid baseline model that can be improved further with advanced feature engineering or ensembling.
